# XIVComboPlugin
This plugin condenses combos and mutually exclusive abilities onto a single button. Thanks to Meli for the initial start, and obviously goat for making any of this possible.

## About
XIVCombo is a plugin to allow for "one-button" combo chains, as well as implementing various other mutually-exclusive button consolidation and quality of life replacements. 

For some jobs, this frees a massive amount of hotbar space (looking at you, DRG). For most, it removes a lot of mindless tedium associated with having to press various buttons that have little logical reason to be separate.

## Installation
* Type `/xlplugins` in-game to access the plugin installer and updater. Any releases on this github page have been removed to facilitate proper installation going forward.
## In-game usage
* Type `/pcombo` to pull up a GUI for editing active combo replacements.
* Drag the named ability from your ability list onto your hotbar to use.
  * For example, to use DRK's Souleater combo, first check the box, then place Souleater on your bar. It should automatically turn into Hard Slash.
  * The description associated with each combo should be enough to tell you which ability needs to be placed on the hotbar.

## Full list of supported combos
There used to be a list here, but it got annoying to update. You should install it and check out what's available!
